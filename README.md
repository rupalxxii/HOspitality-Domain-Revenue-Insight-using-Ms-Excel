➡️About the Project

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
What's in my dashboard:
Filters for city, room type, Property name, month and week Key metrics (Revenue, Occupancy%,  and Realization%). Change over last week.
Revenue generated by hotel category(luxury and business). Weekly trend of key metrics
Realization% by booking platform/ channels
A detailed tabular presentation of metrics of all the properties.

📊 Insights from my dashboard:

➡️There is very small difference in ADR (Average daily rate)generated on
weekdays and weekends, which indicates that hotels are not looking over their
pricing strategy. It should be seen upon to generate more revenue, as the price
factor in this industry is very elastic and changes heavily in weekends and
weekdays.
➡️Direct offline booking platform has the highest overall realization% and ADR, which needs to be worked upon.
➡️More emphasis could be put on booking platforms. 
➡️Hotels with lower ratings should look upon the factors behind the low ratings.
➡️There is a strong correlation between occupancy, ratings and cancellation, because of which hotels should check the ratings, especially if they are operating on online channels
➡️Luxury hotels have generated more revenue as compared to business hotels.
➡️Elite room type have generated highest revenue
➡️The highest revenue and rating have been generated by the same hotel in Mumbai, which is also the best performing city among the other cities

✅️Overall, an effective pricing strategy is needed to increase revenue.
